# FaceRecognitionHOSVD
Tensor Decomposition exam for my Master's degree.

In this project, I have approached the problem of Face Recognition using the High-Order Singular Value Decomposition and its truncated version.

The used is the ORL database that contains 400 images of 10 people. The objective of this work is to discover whether it is possible to use the tensor structure to solve the Face Recognition problem.
